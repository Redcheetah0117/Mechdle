# Updates
# 9-19-2024 (2): 

*Added auto-complete functionality to the search bar. Should speed up guess submission, though a second pass may for optimization with a large unit list.

*Added US Infantry Tab.

*Cleaned up the JS script a little. Still rough, but slightly better.
# 9-19-2024: 

*Added US Logistics Tab, removed FOB. 

*Added functionality to support guess history, and attached previous hints to them. 

*Attempt counter has been temporarily disabled.

*CSS has been updated to be less terrible.

*Some clutter has been removed from the JS, but needs a second pass at some point.
