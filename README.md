# Mechdle
WIP Gamedle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units

This is my first attempt at a web game! I've done a lot of labwork in MATLAB and Python, so this is very new to me still. Attempts will be made to update regularly, though I am a full-time Mech E student. Game can be played through https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/. 

Fair warning: I am not a web designer, that part is being learned as I go. The data storage is also mega scuffed, but that's a later me problem.
# Current Units:
US Logistics, Infantry & Tank Tab

AH-64D Apache Longbow

UK Support & Recon Tabs

SAS

ATGM Milan F1 and F2

# Current Priorities
*QOL stuff

*Get more stats/tags like accuracy implemented (6 or 7 total is the target)

*Add more units

*Make the game not an eyesore
