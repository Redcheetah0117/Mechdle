# Mechdle
WIP Gamedle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units

This is my first attempt at a web game! Attempts will be made to update regularly, though I am a full-time Mech E student. Game can be played through https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/, but be aware, pretty basic functionality currently.

# Current Units:
US Logistics, Infantry & Tank Tab

AH-64D Apache Longbow

UK Support & Recon Tabs

SAS

ATGM Milan F1 and F2

# Current Priorities
*QOL stuff
     
     *Better feedback for hints
     *Cleaned up hint UI

*Get more stats like accuracy implemented

*Add more units

*Make the game not an eyesore
