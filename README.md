# Mechdle
WIP Gamedle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units

This is my first attempt at a web game! Attempts will be made to update regularly, though I am a full-time Mech E student. Game can be played through https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/, but be aware, pretty basic functionality currently. Game can still be reset by refreshing the page.

# Current Units:
US Logistics and Infantry Tab

M1 Abrams Line (Excluding the HC)

AH-64D Apache Longbow

SAS

ATGM Milan F1 and F2

# Current Priorities
*QOL stuff

*Get more stats like FAV and accuracy implemented

*Add more units

*Make the game not an eyesore
