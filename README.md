# Mechdle
WIP Gamedle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units

This is my first attempt at a web game! Most of my experience is labwork in MATLAB and Python, so this is new to me still. Attempts will be made to update regularly, though I am a full-time Mech E student. Game can be played through https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/. 

Fair warning: I am not a web designer, that part is being learned as I go. I also haven't implemented a proper dataset yet (I'm just plugging values into a JSON to test for now), but that's a later me problem.
# Current Units:
US Logistics, Infantry & Tank Tab

AH-64D Apache Longbow

UK Support & Recon Tabs

SAS

ATGM Milan F1 and F2

# Current Priorities
*QOL stuff

*Get more stats/tags like accuracy implemented (6 or 7 total is the target, though have ideas for how to implement more while keeping game fair)

*Implement units in a better way

*Make the game not an eyesore
