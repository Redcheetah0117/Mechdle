# Mechdle
WIP Gamedle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units

This is my first attempt at a web game! Attempts will be made to update regularly, though I am a full-time Mech E student. Game can be played through https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/, but be aware, VERY basic functionality currently (I broke reset at some point, and the attempt counter is currently off for debugging purposes) Game can still be reset by refreshing the page.

# Current Units:
US Logistics Tab

M1 Abrams Line

AH-64D Apache Longbow

SAS

ATGM Milan F1 and F2
